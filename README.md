  Objective
</h2>

The objective of this project is to build a 2D game using the school graphical library (MinilibX) where you have the player character that has to get all the collectibles and get to the exit.

The bonus part you also have to add an enemy, a sprite animation and a movement count displayed directly on the screen.
